                <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Is A Programming Paradigm 
                    Based On The Concept Of Objects, Which Encapsulate Data And 
                    Behavior. It Focuses On Four Core Principles: Encapsulation, 
                    Inheritance, Polymorphism, And Abstraction. OOP Enhances Code 
                    Reusability, Scalability, And Maintainability By Organizing 
                    Code Into Reusable Classes And Objects. It Is Widely Used In 
                    Modern Software Development For Designing Complex Applications, 
                    Game Development, And System Programming. Popular OOP Languages 
                    Include Java, Python, C++, And C#.

                <p>
                    Data Structure Is A Fundamental Concept In Computer Science 
                    That Organizes And Stores Data Efficiently For Easy Access 
                    And Modification. It Includes Various Types Such As Arrays, 
                    Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, And Hash Tables. 
                    Each Data Structure Is Designed For Specific Operations To 
                    Optimize Performance In Different Scenarios. Efficient Use Of 
                    Data Structures Enhances Algorithm Performance, Reducing Time 
                    And Space Complexity. They Are Widely Used In Software 
                    Development, Database Management, Networking, And Artificial
